## Overview

This project is a sand simulation built with TypeScript and PIXI.js. It's a fun and interactive way to simulate the physics of sand particles. You can add particles to the simulation, change their color, and watch as they interact with each other.

## Features

- **Particle System**: The core of the simulation is a particle system where each particle is represented as an instance of a `Particle` class or its subclass `Sand`. The particles can interact with each other, simulating the physics of sand.
- **Color Selection**: You can change the color of the particles that you add to the simulation.
- **Responsive Design**: The sand simulation is designed to work seamlessly on both PC and mobile devices.
